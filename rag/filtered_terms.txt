Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to return a list of terms from a given text that don't contain the '$' character. The user provided a text snippet and specified that the output should be a Python list within square brackets. 

First, I'll read through the provided text to understand what's being discussed. The text seems to be about some kind of optimization problem, possibly related to machine learning or AI, given the mention of 'probabilistic' and 'minimax' strategies. 

Looking at the text, I see a section discussing a problem involving a function Q(s, a) and a set of possible actions A. The user is trying to find the optimal action a that minimizes the maximum value of Q(s, a) over all possible states s. 

The text mentions a minimax strategy, which is a common approach in game theory and AI where the player minimizes the maximum possible loss. It also talks about the possibility of having multiple optimal
